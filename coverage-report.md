# Test Coverage Analysis Report

## Current Coverage Status
As of the last test run, the application has **very low test coverage**:

- **Statements**: 1.37% (Target: 60%)
- **Branches**: 0.82% (Target: 60%)
- **Lines**: 1.41% (Target: 60%)
- **Functions**: 0.4% (Target: 60%)

## Files with Coverage

### API Routes (Partially Covered)
- `src/app/api/auth-status/route.ts` - 40.35% coverage
- `src/app/api/pos/sales/route.ts` - 63.52% coverage

### Other Files
- `src/middleware.ts` - 30% coverage
- Most other files have 0% coverage

## Test Issues to Fix

### 1. Mock Issues
- Prisma `$disconnect` method needs proper mocking
- Authentication middleware tests failing due to missing cache headers
- Some API route tests are not properly mocked

### 2. Integration Tests
- Database integration tests require proper test database setup
- Currently failing due to database connection issues

### 3. Unit Tests
- Most components and utility functions lack unit tests
- Business logic in actions/ directory is not tested

## Areas Needing Immediate Testing

### High Priority (Business Logic)
1. **API Routes** (`src/app/api/`)
   - Authentication flows
   - POS sales system
   - Inventory management
   - User management

2. **Server Actions** (`src/app/actions/`)
   - Pet management
   - Medical records
   - Inventory operations
   - Sales operations

3. **Utility Functions** (`src/utils/`)
   - POS helpers
   - Price calculations
   - Format utilities

### Medium Priority (Components)
1. **Form Components**
   - Client forms
   - Pet forms
   - POS forms

2. **Business Components**
   - Sales tables
   - Inventory displays
   - Medical record forms

### Low Priority (UI Components)
1. **Layout Components**
   - Navigation
   - Headers/Footers
   - Static pages

2. **UI Components**
   - Buttons, dialogs, etc. (excluded from coverage)

## Recommendations

1. **Fix existing test issues** - Get current tests passing
2. **Add API route tests** - Focus on business-critical endpoints
3. **Add utility function tests** - Test calculation logic
4. **Add integration tests** - Test database operations
5. **Add component tests** - Test form validation and business logic
6. **Set up proper test database** - For integration testing

## Coverage Goals
- **Phase 1**: Fix existing tests, reach 15% coverage
- **Phase 2**: Add API and utility tests, reach 40% coverage
- **Phase 3**: Add component tests, reach 60% coverage
- **Phase 4**: Add integration tests, reach 80% coverage
